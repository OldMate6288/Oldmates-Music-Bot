Oldmate's Music Bot v1.0.1, made for testing Discord bot development. Needs a lot more features added but for now it simply works and can play/stop music.

HOW TO SETUP:

1. Open folder in VS Code (or your desired IDE)
2. Run a new terminal and install node_modules with 'npm install'
2. Put your Discord token in index.js
3. OPTIONAL: Uncomment code from line 24 onwards and enter your desired Channel ID if you want the bot to welcome new members and add a role
4. Type 'node .' into terminal to run, Ctrl+C to end the process or set it up to run from your VPS
